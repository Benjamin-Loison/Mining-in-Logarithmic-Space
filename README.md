# Mining in Logarithmic Space
Based on the article "Mining in Logarithmic Space" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/623.pdf) here is an implementation for Bitcoin blockchain

It enables us to compress the 358 GB Bitcoin blockchain to 4.3 GB while ensuring strong security properties.

If you have a look to piX.svg due to 4 130 elements displayed (rectangles and texts showing the difficulty in logarithmic base 2) I recommend to use a rendering software like Firefox (because Inkscape and Gimp don't seem to suport this vectorial representation).
