# Mining in Logarithmic Space

Based on the article "Mining in Logarithmic Space" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/623.pdf) here is an implementation for Bitcoin blockchain

Research internship that took place from Juny to July 2021 at [INRIA Rennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation) under [Emmanuelle Anceaume](https://people.irisa.fr/Emmanuelle.Anceaume/) supervision.

It enables us to compress the 358 GB Bitcoin blockchain to 4.3 GB while ensuring strong security properties.

If you have a look to `piX.svg` due to 4 130 elements displayed (rectangles and texts showing the difficulty in logarithmic base 2) I recommend to use a rendering software like Firefox (because Inkscape and Gimp don't seem to support this vectorial representation).
